# Project goals

- This app's functionality allows users to create projects with a title and due date and add tasks to those projects. It includes an inbox tab where tasks that are not part of a project can be added and also lets users see which tasks are due today and this week.
- The goal of this project was mainly to combine what I have learnt so far about how to dynamically create obejcts as well as more DOM manipulation and usage of modules.
- This was a particularly difficult project as there were a lot of new things to learn and combine together such as using the date-fns library and figuring out how to use local storage to store data on a user's machine.
- Overall, this project taught me a lot about the importance of separating ui and app logic into different modules. It was great practice for bigger projects in the future and I'm happy with how it turned out!
